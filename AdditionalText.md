# Additional Text

The following contain amendments which prescribe action when ratified, but do not necessarily have a continuous effect.

## Language Name Change

We the Core Working Group establish on 2020-12-28 that the Language being developed by the Core Working Group and all other Working Groups shall be known as Cannon from this point forward. 

* All instances of the name Laser occuring in the Governance shall be replaced with Cannon. 
    * The Project Manager is authorized and ordered to perform any and all amendments to the Governance to this effect with no further extent unilatterally. 
* The Project Manager shall cease operations of the Core Working Group using the name Laser, and shall commence all future operations and discussions using the name Cannon.
* The chairs of each working group other than the Core Working Group are hereby ordered to cease operations using the name Laser, and shall carry out all future operations and discussions using the name Cannon. This order shall not be overturned by the Working Group. 
* The chair of the compiler working group, in collaboration with the Core Working Group, is ordered to establish the names for the sections of the Cannon Language Specification reserved to and for the compiler working group except that no section reserved to any other working group may be reserved in this way.
    * The resulting sections shall be documented and published in an approved report. 
* The chair of the community working group is ordered to make public this name change in all forums which it deems necessary and proper to do so by any mechanism the working group deems fit. 
* All orders listed above are to be considered to have the authority of this Governance and any amendment thereof. The Core Working Group shall not dipose of any order listed above, except by amendment.
* Any text in any existing paper which refers to the Language by the name Laser shall be deemed to use the name Cannon instead. The Responsible Working Group chair shall, in a timely manner, submit a revised version with changes to this effect for approval, unless the Project Manager or the Core Working Group, by *simple-majority* deem it unnecessary for any specific paper.

4. The Core Working Group may, by approval of a simple-majority, cause (1) to become void at any time.
5. At the expiry of this amendment as prescribed by (3), or on application of (4), all changes made to the specification of the Cannon Language following the date of adoption, shall be repealed and presented by the Project Manager to the Core Working Group for approval as a technical specification, and shall be restored to the specification upon approval.
