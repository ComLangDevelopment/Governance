# Laser Language Project Manager

Through a Method provided for by any previous Project Manager as below, or lacking such a mechanism, a method which the Core Working Group may as a whole dictate,
 the Community of the Cannon Language shall elect or appoint a Project Manager, who is not inelligable for the position. 

The Project Manager has oversight of all working groups, and shall act as chair of the Core Working Group.
Additionally, the project manager is granted the following authority and responsibilities:
* Order any Working Group Chair to alter the method on which papers are reviewed and approved by that working group, the method of communication within that working group, and the method of filings votes of non-confidence. The project manager shall do so only if they believe that the method currently in use is not appropriate for the Working Group. 
* Order that any paper they deem inappropriate or incorrect for a working group to be discarded by that working group, and resubmitted to the proper working group if allowable. This order may be overturned by concurrence of 2/3s of the members of that working group, including the chair of that group. 
* In the event that the Core Working Group is tied for *simple-majority* in any vote,  offer a 2nd vote as a method to resolve the tie. 
* Start a process to remove any Working Group Chair from their position, and from the Core Working Group, which shall be effective on concurrence of 2/3s of the Members of the Core Working Group. A new working group chair shall be elected upon such a removal.
Should a chair be the removed by the above, they shall not be admitted back in any chair position, regardless if they have been voted in by election, without the consent of the Core Working Group that shall be granted upon *two-thirds majority*. 
* Establish, and document through an approved report, the mechanism under which vacancies in any chair position may be filled, when such vacancies need to be filled, and how the authorities and responsibilities of any chair position are excercised when that chair position is vacant, subject to policy established the particular working group.
* Issue any other reasonable order to any Working Group chair to act within their official capacity, except when the order is vacated by either 2/3s of the membership of the working group, or a *simple-majority* vote of the Core Working Group. A *simple-majority* vote of the Core Working Group may excercise the same, including against the Project Manager. 


The Project Manager must have the confidence of the Core Working Group. A *simple-majority* vote of the Core Working Group may remote a Project Manager on the basis of non-confidence. 

A person who is chair of any Working Group is ineligible to be the Project Manager, and the Project Manager is ineligible to chair any Working Group, except for the Core Working Group. A person who is otherwise ineligible to be a Working Group chair is also ineligible to be the Project Manager.
