# Laser Language Project Manager

The Chairs of each Working Group, asside from the Core Working Group, shall elect a Project Manager,
 who is not acting as the chair of any working group. 

The Project Manager has oversight of all working groups, and shall act as chair of the Core Working Group.
Additionally, the project manager is granted the following authority and responsibilities:
* The project manager may order any Working Group Chair to alter the method on which papers are reviewed and approved by that working group, the method of communication within that working group, and the method of filings votes of non-confidence. The project manager shall do so only if they believe that the method currently in use is not appropriate for the Working Group. 
* The project manager may order that any paper they deem inappropriate or incorrect for a working group to be discarded by that working group, and resubmitted to the proper working group if allowable. This order may be overturned by concurrence of 2/3s of the members of that working group, including the chair of that group. 

* In the event that the Core Working Group is tied for *simple-majority* in any vote, the project manager may offer a 2nd vote as a method to resolve the tie. 
* The Project Manager may start a process to remove any Working Group Chair from their position, and from the Core Working Group, which shall be effective on concurrence of 2/3s of the Members of the Core Working Group. A new working group chair shall be elected upon such a removal. 
Should a chair be removed by majority vote, he/she shall not be admitted back in any chair position indefinitely, regardless if they have been voted in by election. If the public votes in a former chair which was removed by majority votes by the council, the council should see to admit the second most votes, and any runner-up after the fact. If there are no other candidates to be considered, the Chairs should see another election, or assign the position to whomever is deemed fit.

The Project Manager must have the confidence of the Core Working Group. A *simple-majority* vote of the Core Working Group may remote a Project Manager on the basis of non-confidence. 

A person who is chair of any Working Group is ineligible to be the Project Manager, and the Project Manager is ineligible to chair any Working Group, except for the Core Working Group. A person who is otherwise ineligible to be a Working Group chair is also ineligible to be the Project Manager.
