# Groups

This document Describes the working groups which develop the language and library of Laser. 
These groups are responsible for recieving and voting on papers that change the language in a specific way. 
To join a Working Group (except for Core), contact the chair of that group. 
It is the reponsibility of the chair to determine the rules for entry to a working group. 

## All Groups

The Working Groups established for this language are as follows:
* Core Working Group: Highest authority in the language, all stable changes to both language and library must be approved by Core. The Core Working Group retains all authority and responsibility which is not delegated to a different working group.
* Language Design Working Group: Language Syntax and Semantics
* Library Design Working Group: Standard and Core Libraries
* Compiler Working Group: Maintence on the Compiler for the Language.
* Embedded Working Group: Providing Support for embedded development using the language
* Game Development Working Group: Providing Support for Game Development

## Group Chairs

The community shall, for each working group, elect a chair of that working group. 
The chair has the following responsibilities:
* Organizing the Working Group
* Admitting people to the working group
* Providing on a method of communication, discussion, and voting for papers recieved by the group
* Providing a method to recieve papers from outside the group, and originate papers from within the group.
* Submitting papers voted on by their working group to the core working group. 

The chair of each working group needs the confidence of the members. A majority vote of the working group may remove the sitting chair. These chairs are responsible for providing a system which allows working group members to issue votes of non-confidence. 

Should a chair be removed by majority vote, they shall not be admitted back in any chair position, regardless if they have been voted in an election without consent of the Core Working Group which shall be granted upon *two-thirds majority*. If the public votes in a former chair which was removed by majority votes, the council should see to admit the second most votes, and any runner-up after the fact. If there are no other candidates to be considered, the Chairs should see another election, or assign the position to whomever is deemed fit.

The chair of each working, along with a Project Manager who acts as the chair, shall form the membership of the Core Working Group. 

No person may serve as the chair of more than one Working Group at any one time.
